# Cortex
You want to know the answer to some problem or question immediately. Normally, you'd Google your question. But what happens when you don't have wifi, and you've reached your data cap? Or what if you're traveling in a foreign country and data access is unreliable or expensive? 

Meet Cortex! An Android app designed to help you answer your questions, without the need for data. Cortex uses SMS to communicate to a backend server, which will search the internet on your behalf, and send a summarized version of its search results back to you via text message!

We eventually hope to include the ability to browse the internet offline by having our backend return minified html pages via text message.

So why is the name "Cortex"? Since our service returns the "core" sentences that answer your questions as a "text" message, we felt "Cortex" was appropriate. Also, Cortex has a meaning in the biological context, as a layer of tissue of the brain. We want to provide the answers that your brain hungers for, unfettered by something as mundane as needing data.
