# Cortex
You want to know the answer to some problem or question immediately. Normally, you'd Google your question. But what happens when you don't have wifi, and you've reached your data cap? 

Meet Cortex! An Android app designed to help you answer your questions, without the need for data. Cortex uses SMS to communicate to a backend server, which will search the internet on your behalf, and send a summarized version of its search results back to you via text message!

We eventually hope to include the ability to browse the internet offline by having our backend return minified html pages via text message.
